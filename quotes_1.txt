Place a colon after the 
introduction to the quotation, and 
indent the whole quotation one 
inch from the left side. These 
quotations can be either single 
or double-‚Äê spaced, and should 
not contain quotation marks 
unless they occur in the 
original text. 
For quotations that are 
more than four lines of 
prose or three lines of 
verse, place quotations 
in a free-standing block 
of text and omit quotation 
marks. Start the quotation on a 
new line, with the entire 
quote indented 1/2 inch from 
the left margin while 
maintaining double-spacing.
